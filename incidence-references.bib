              doubling times of between 16 and 30 days.(1) On the basis of case
              reports through mid-September, and assuming no change in the
              trajectory of the epidemic, we predicted a cumulative total of
              21,000 cases in these three countries by November 2.(1) In fact,
              the epidemic did change course in September: the increase in case
              incidence appears to have halted in Guinea and Sierra Leone and
              has reversed in Liberia (Figure 1). . . .",

              and potential impact of an outbreak, several types of data are
              necessary. Here we build on experience gained in the West African
              Ebola epidemic and prior emerging infectious disease outbreaks to
              set out a checklist of data needed to: (1) quantify severity and

              transmission and their determinants; and (3) assess the
              effectiveness of different interventions. We differentiate data
              needs into individual-level data (e.g. a detailed list of
              reported cases), exposure data (e.g. identifying where/how cases
              may have been infected) and population-level data (e.g.
              size/demographics of the population(s) affected and when/where
              interventions were implemented). A remarkable amount of
              individual-level and exposure data was collected during the West
              African Ebola epidemic, which allowed the assessment of (1) and
              (2). However, gaps in population-level data (particularly around
              which interventions were applied when and where) posed challenges

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization
              (WHO) was notified of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in
              Guinea. On August 8, the WHO declared the epidemic to be a
              ``public health emergency of international concern.'' METHODS: By
              September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases,
              including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported
              from five countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria,
              Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We analyzed a detailed subset of data
              on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases collected in
              Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14.
              RESULTS: The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age
              (49.9\% male), and we estimate that the case fatality rate is
              70.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 73) among persons
              with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of
              infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4
              days), and serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that
              reported in previous outbreaks of EVD. On the basis of the
              initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated basic
              reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95\% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for
              Guinea, 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95\%
              CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra Leone. The estimated current
              reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95\% CI, 1.60 to 2.03) for
              Guinea, 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95\%
              CI, 1.27 to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling
              times are 15.7 days (95\% CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days
              (95\% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and 30.2 days (95\% CI, 23.6
              to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the control
              measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative
              reported numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to
              be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone,
              exceeding 20,000 in total. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that
              without drastic improvements in control measures, the numbers of
              cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue increasing
              from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.",

              reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the
              value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly
              from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such
              inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that
              relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
              unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection.
              Here, we show that these different equations differ only with
              respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval
              distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
              distribution determines which equation is appropriate for
              inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate.
              We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to

              values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth

              interventions and ``fog of war'' in outbreak data made available
              for predictions. Prediction targets included 1--4 week-ahead case
              incidences, outbreak size, peak timing, and several natural
              history parameters. With respect to weekly case incidence
              targets, ensemble predictions based on a Bayesian average of the
              8 participating models outperformed any individual model and did
              substantially better than a null auto-regressive model. There was
              no relationship between model complexity and prediction accuracy;
              however, the top performing models for short-term weekly
              incidence were reactive models with few parameters, fitted to a
              short and recent part of the outbreak. Individual model outputs
              and ensemble predictions improved with data accuracy and
              availability; by the second time point, just before the peak of
              the epidemic, estimates of final size were within 20\% of the
              target. The 4th challenge scenario − mirroring an uncontrolled
              Ebola outbreak with substantial data reporting noise − was poorly
              predicted by all modeling teams. Overall, this synthetic
              forecasting challenge provided a deep understanding of model
              performance under controlled data and epidemiological conditions.
              We recommend such ``peace time'' forecasting challenges as key
              elements to improve coordination and inspire collaboration
              between modeling groups ahead of the next pandemic threat, and to
              assess model forecasting accuracy for a variety of known and

              weekly basis. Therefore, short-term forecasts of incidence are
              often of high priority. In light of the recent Ebola epidemic in
              West Africa, a forecasting exercise was convened by a network of
              infectious disease modellers. The challenge was to forecast
              unseen ``future'' simulated data for four different scenarios at
              five different time points. In a similar method to that used
              during the recent Ebola epidemic, we estimated current levels of
              transmissibility, over variable time-windows chosen in an ad hoc
              way. Current estimated transmissibility was then used to forecast
              near-future incidence. We performed well within the challenge and
              often produced accurate forecasts. A retrospective analysis
              showed that our subjective method for deciding on the window of
              time with which to estimate transmissibility often resulted in
              the optimal choice. However, when near-future trends deviated
              substantially from exponential patterns, the accuracy of our
              forecasts was reduced. This exercise highlights the urgent need
              for infectious disease modellers to develop more robust
              descriptions of processes - other than the widespread depletion
              of susceptible individuals - that produce non-exponential
              patterns of incidence.",

              responses. By analyzing the outbreak in Mexico, early data on
              international spread, and viral genetic diversity, we make an
              early assessment of transmissibility and severity. Our estimates
              suggest that 23,000 (range 6000 to 32,000) individuals had been
              infected in Mexico by late April, giving an estimated case
              fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.4\% (range: 0.3 to 1.8\%) based on
              confirmed and suspected deaths reported to that time. In a
              community outbreak in the small community of La Gloria, Veracruz,
              no deaths were attributed to infection, giving an upper 95\%
              bound on CFR of 0.6\%. Thus, although substantial uncertainty
              remains, clinical severity appears less than that seen in the
              1918 influenza pandemic but comparable with that seen in the 1957
              pandemic. Clinical attack rates in children in La Gloria were
              twice that in adults (/=15 years: 29\%). Three different
              epidemiological analyses gave basic reproduction number (R0)
              estimates in the range of 1.4 to 1.6, whereas a genetic analysis
              gave a central estimate of 1.2. This range of values is
              consistent with 14 to 73 generations of human-to-human
              transmission having occurred in Mexico to late April.
              Transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than that of
              seasonal flu, and comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained
